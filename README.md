#  NodeMCU + DS18B20 medical data collection and analysis
## Getting Started
  IOT based system for medical data collection and analysis. This application runs on an WiFi connected ESP8266 NodeMCU which gets readings from a Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensor (later on a MELEXIS sensor). Data are uploaded on a constant basis into ThingSpeak (https://thingspeak.com) cloud data analysis service where are processed and dipslayed accordingly.
 
### Prerequisites

A NodeMCU 8266 development board

A Dallas 18B20 temperature sensor

Adruino IDE



### Installing



You need to load these libraries to Arduino IDE
